# SVG Logo Maker 

## Description
This project involved creating a simple command-line tool to generate SVG logos with customizable shapes, colors, and letters. The SVG Logo Maker allows you to create your own SVG logos by choosing up to 3 letters, a shape, (circle, square, or triangle), and specifying a color. The tool generates an SVG file with the specified characteristics which can be opened in a browser to view the resulting logo.

## Usage
This application is run from the command line and can be invoked by using the command 'node index.js'. Follow the prompts to enter the shape type, color, and dimensions for your logo. After completing the prompts, an SVG file named `logo.svg` will be generated in the project directory. Open this file in a browser to view your logo.
